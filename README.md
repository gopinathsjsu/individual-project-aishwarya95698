# Problem Statement
The objective of the project is to develop a JAVA application for a user to purchase products online.The application should maintain an internal, static database. This means once we re-run the program, the changes to the data would not persist. The user is only allowed to buy a certain number of products from each category available. The order should satisfy the given requirements, and if it does, a bill amount should be generated. If the order does not satisfy the requirements, an output.txt file should be generated, stating the limitation should be generated.Output file type for a successfully processed order will be a .csv and for all other cases a .txt file.

# Steps to run the program
1. Create a folder by cloning the repository in which all the files are present.
2. Change the current directory to the src file.
3. Move the current directory to the src file.
4. To compile the source code run :  'Javac Billing.java' in src folder.
5. After compilation in src folder run : 'java Billing'.
6. Once you run the above command you would be asked to enter the input file path.
